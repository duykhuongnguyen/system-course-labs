Single-Bit Communication Protocol

Encode:
- Bit 1: Sender accesses 300 unique cache lines at 64-byte intervals to fill L2.
- Bit 0: Sender does not access the buffer and sleeps for BIT_DURATION_US.

Receive:
- Receiver probes same memory layout, measuring access latency to each line.

Decode:
- Receiver calculates average access latency across 300 lines.
- If average > THRESHOLD (150), bit = 1. Otherwise, bit = 0.

Threshold:
- Empirically derived from timing experiments.
  - Bit 0: ~96 cycles
  - Bit 1: ~300â€“370 cycles
  - Chosen threshold = 150 cycles
